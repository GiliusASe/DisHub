That year, through the company, he and Cassel developed Interactive Physics, a 2D physics simulation.[3][4] Knowledge Revolution followed this up with Working Model, which simulated mechanical devices.[3] The company was eventually purchased in December 1998 for US$20 million by MSC Software, where Baszucki and Cassel obtained senior positions.[3][5] Baszucki was the company's vice president and general manager from 2000 until 2002, when he left MSC Software to establish Baszucki & Associates, an angel investment firm.[5] He and Cassel founded Roblox Corporation in 2004.[4][5] Working from an office in Menlo Park, California, they began preliminary work on the video game DynaBlocks, which was launched in a beta state later that year.[3][5] The game's name was changed to Roblox in 2005, and the game was formally released on September 1, 2006.");
